# Fruit-Inspection
## Some Useful info:-

Open each task folder in a separate window. I don't know why but if opened in the same window, i'm getting image path not found error!!!(if you find the reason for this error let me know)

under Task one Folder, FirstTask.py is the file you need to run!

In Task two Folder, SecondTaskUpdated.py is the one that gives the best output so run that!*Pay attention to the contents displayed on the terminal!! it lets u know what to do*

For Task Final Folder, It's the finalTask.py.

Any questions or suggestions for improvement..feel free to Text me over on whatsapp!
